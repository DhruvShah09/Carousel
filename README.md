# Carousel
## Description
Carousel is a tool which embraces the academic culture at Georgia Tech, or any University, and allows students to find study groups for any particular class, at any particular time. 
Users first create an account, and in the process define their year, classes, and other attributes such as username, account name, and password. By "Riding the Carousel",
users are placed in a randomized group of students seeking to study the same course, at the same time, in the same location. From the user's side, the operation is seamless.
Carousel handles the matchmaking, and the student reaps the benefits of quality study-time along with newly formed peer-on-peer relationships.
